# List of versions
Here's a cool little list of versions. These are ordered by date, and I started using the 1.x architechture again, but the 1.0.x & 1.1.x are the latest.

## v0.9.0
Simple plain-text with header parsing.
## v1.0.0
Simple base64 encoding.
## v2.0.0
## v2.1.0
## v3.1.0
## v3.1.3
## v4.0.0
## v4.1.0
## v4.2.0
## v4.2.1
## v4.2.2
## v5.0.0
## v5.0.1
## v5.0.2
## v1.0.2
v1.0.2 is a much different version of base64, encoding multiple times. This version of the engine is still in decently heavy use, so the code isn't released.
## v1.0.2-ghc
The 'ghc' branch is for github, and has variations in the amount of encoding/decodings.
## v1.1.0
This build is the latest engine, and includes mutiple enhancements.
